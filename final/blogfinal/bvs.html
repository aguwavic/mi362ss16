				<p>Batman v Superman was I movie I had high exceptions for and was disappointed. The movie starts of with a ridiculous dream sequence were young  Bruce Wayne is taken to the sky by bats. This ridiculousness does not end here. Multiple dream sequence that people how have not read the comics will not understand lasted through the movie. The title of the movie suggested the focus of two superheroes engaging in combat though this did happen the reason for it did not make any sense. Even with these faults the movie looked amazing (other than Doomsday). While I was disappointed in the movie it was not a bad one time watch. </p>
