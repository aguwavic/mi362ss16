<h2>Brief History</h2>

<img id="stick" src="rokustick.jpg" width="161" height="200" alt="stick"align="middle"/>
<p>
The company that have decided to research is Roku,Inc. Roku, Inc is responsible for creating the Roku streaming player. 
Before getting in to the tech stack I will provide a brief summary on the company's history. 
Roku,Inc when Netflix was about to release a streaming player to stream Netflix content. The CEO at the time, Reed Hasting, 
thought it would be a better idea to make Roku it's own company so that other streaming platforms would be willing to put their applications on this device. 
So this allowed services like Hulu,Amazon Video and HBO to put their service on the streaming device. 
This later result in the Netflix streaming device to be released as the Roku and Roku,Inc., was created in 2008.
